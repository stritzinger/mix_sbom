Generates a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBoM) for Mix projects, in [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org)
format.

Full documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/sbom](https://hexdocs.pm/sbom).

For a quick demo of how this might be used, check out [this blog post](https://blog.voltone.net/post/24).

## Installation

This tool can be installed in several ways:

### 1. Project Dependency (Recommended for development)

Add the dependency to your project's `mix.exs` (development only):

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sbom, "~> 0.6", only: :dev, runtime: false},
    # If using Elixir < 1.18 and want JSON output, also add:
    # {:jason, "~> 1.4"}
  ]
end
```

### 2. Mix Escript (Global installation)

Install the Mix task globally on your system:

```bash
mix escript.install hex sbom
```

### 3. Escript (From releases)

Download the escript from the [releases page](https://github.com/erlef/mix_sbom/releases) 
(requires BEAM runtime locally).

### 4. Burrito Binary (From releases)

Download the self-contained binary from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/erlef/mix_sbom/releases) 
(does not require BEAM runtime).

## Usage

### As a Mix Task (project dependency only)

When installed as a project dependency, run from the project directory 
containing `mix.exs`:

```bash
mix sbom.cyclonedx
```

The result is written to `bom.cdx.json` unless a different name is specified 
using the `-o` option. Use `-d` to include dev/test dependencies.

### As a Standalone Binary (escript install/download or Burrito)

When using the globally installed escript, downloaded escript, or Burrito 
binary, you must provide the project path as an argument:

```bash
# Global escript or downloaded binary
sbom /path/to/your/project

# Or with options
sbom --output=my-sbom.json --format=json /path/to/your/project
```

### Common Notes

By default only production dependencies are included. To include all 
dependencies (dev and test environments), use the `-d` or `--dev` option.

*Note that MIX_ENV does not affect which dependencies are included in the
output; the task should normally be run in the default (dev) environment*

For more information:
- Mix task: `mix help sbom.cyclonedx`  
- Standalone binary: `sbom --help`

## GitHub Action

This tool is also available as a GitHub Action for use in CI/CD workflows. 
The action downloads and verifies the provenance of the binary, then generates
an SBoM for your project.

### Basic Usage

```yaml
- name: Generate SBoM
  uses: erlef/mix_sbom@v0
  id: sbom
  with:
    project-path: ${{ github.workspace }}
    schema: "1.6"
    format: "json"

- name: Display SBoM
  run: cat "$SBOM_FILE"
  env:
    SBOM_FILE: ${{ steps.sbom.outputs.sbom-path }}
```

### Inputs

- `project-path`: Path to the directory containing mix.exs 
  (defaults to repository root)
- `schema`: CycloneDX schema version (defaults to "1.6")
- `format`: Output format, either "json" or "xml" (defaults to "json")
- `reuse-beam`: Use local BEAM installation instead of pre-compiled binaries
  (defaults to "false")

### Outputs

- `sbom-path`: Path to the generated SBoM file

The action automatically handles downloading the correct binary for your 
runner's architecture and verifies its provenance using GitHub's attestation
system.

### Using Local BEAM (Recommended)

For the most accurate dependency analysis, it's recommended to use the local 
BEAM installation by setting `reuse-beam: true`. This approach:

- Properly detects Elixir and Erlang versions in the generated SBoM
- Works with your project's specific runtime environment
- Provides more accurate dependency information

To use this approach, first set up Elixir/Erlang in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Set up Elixir
  uses: erlef/setup-beam@v1
  with:
    elixir-version: '1.17.3'
    otp-version: '27.1'

- name: Get dependencies
  run: mix deps.get

- name: Generate SBoM
  uses: erlef/mix_sbom@v0
  with:
    reuse-beam: true
```

**Note**: For most detailed dependency analysis, you should run `mix deps.get`
before using this action to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

## NPM packages and other dependencies

This tool only considers Hex, GitHub and BitBucket dependencies managed through
Mix. To build a comprehensive SBoM of a deployment, including NPM and/or
operating system packages, it may be necessary to merge multiple CycloneDX files
into one.

The [@cyclonedx/bom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/bom) tool on NPM
can not only generate an SBoM for your JavaScript assets, but it can also merge
in the output of the 'sbom.cyclonedx' Mix task and other scanners, through the
'-a' option, producing a single CycloneDX XML file.
